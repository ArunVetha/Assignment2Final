# API

The overall objective of the website is for other users to search users by their name
Not only that, users can view the location, number of repositories and bio of the serached profile

Short Demo of how the website looks like and it's features, view it here - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e9YJQ2wg9y_PYkUlwHObBAlQflwU0fzl/view?usp=sharing
 
## Design Process
 
Initially I wanted this API to be simple and didn't want to add lots of data and fill it with bloatwares, but then I added resources which could be considered relavant and useful. Then the Navigation bar which I had to choose whether or not to keep it moving or static since its just for usual and no distinct pages are linked. Followed by overall visual that suggested me to add image backgrounds. Additional features other than just name searches.

- As a user, my API website design should be supported on all platforms.
- As a user, my API website's source code should be error free.
- As a user, the API website's data should be simple and easy to understand.
- As a student, how do I perfect the API website without using any other external code or different language.
- As a user, a API website should be made more colorful and visually pleasing.

## Features

My project allows users to search and view profiles of other users. The data available are name, number of repositories, bio, and location.
For example:
Name: Arun
Repositories: 10
Location: Singapore
Bio: I love coding.
 
### Existing Features
- Cool Feature - see their (searched profile's) bio and location if they have provided one.
Some additional feature which could be included are some fun games, discussion board, direct chat terminal, latest updates on github database (live feed), New users, usaage of advanced CSS, utilising javascript / JSON / Bootstrap / JQuery, repository accesses.

### Features Left to Implement
- some additional features if possible 
  - Repository access on the API site
  - Latest updates on github database (live feed of new profiles)

## Technologies Used

- HTML (https://html.com)
    - This assignment is highly based on HTML. To be it's a markup language for documents designed for the internet and the browser.

- CSS (https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
    - The project uses cascading style sheets for visual arrangements and decorations for the site.

- Fetch API
    - Fetch() allows you to make network requests similar to XMLHttpRequest (XHR). The main difference is that the Fetch API uses Promises.

- Github API
    - You can use the GitHub REST API to create calls to get the data you need to integrate with GitHub.
    
- Postman
    -  Postman Interceptor helps you send requests which use browser cookies through the Postman app.

## Testing

1. Overall website:
    1. Make sure that all hyperlink is working.
    2. Make sure that the requests are fine and we get the necessary data back.
    3. Be sure that the results are accurate and instant.
    4. Check if the user data matches with that of the github pull request.

2. Projects page:
    1. Try to align the contents accordingly, which could vary for different platforms.  

3. Lack of content:
    1. At the end after coding APIs and getting it to work, I struggled a bit to add few extra features
    
4. Image path:
    1. There seem to be some problem with the image path, sometimes the relative path works and sometime it doesn't. In that case, the path which consisted of personal directory information was used but It may not work on the lecturers's system since the path has the student's directory. So relative paths were used but sometimes they seem broken for images and it works fine for CSS linking. This is the same case as in assignment 1.

In addition, the assignment looks and works fine on different browsers and screen sizes.
The platforms tested are - Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Android, IOS and opera.

I came accross several bugs and careless mistakes from simple missed hyphens to troublesome flex screens. But most of them are fixed. One of the interesting things was when I found out about stacking contents side by side and then re-shuffling the dual grid.
