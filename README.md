## Design Process
 
Initially I wanted this API to be simple and didn't want to add lots of data and fill it with bloatwares, but then I added resources which could be considered relavant and useful. Then the Navigation bar which I had to choose whether or not to keep it moving or static. Followed by overall visual that suggested me to add image backgrounds.

- As a user, my website design should be supported on all platforms.
- As a user, my website's source code should be error free.
- As a user, the website's data shouldn't overwhelm me.
- As a student, how do I perfect the website without using any other external code or different language.
- As a user, a website should be made more colorful and visually pleasing.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Cool Feature - allows users to attend a small quiz about me.
Some additional feature which could be included are some fun games, discussion board, direct chat terminal, some videos and pictures of me, school history, usaage of advanced CSS, utilising javascript and DOM.

### Features Left to Implement
- Design Refinements

## Technologies Used

- HTML (https://html.com)
    - This assignment is highly based on HTML. To be it's a markup language for documents designed for the internet and the browser.

- CSS (https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
    - The project uses cascading style sheets for visual arrangements and decorations for the site.


## Testing

1. Overall website:
    1. Make sure that all hyperlink is working.
    2. Make sure that the navigation bar is functional.
    3. Be sure that the survey link collects user identification when doing the quiz.
    4. Check if the color schemes matches with different pages.

2. Projects page:
    1. Try to align the contents accordingly, which could vary for different platforms.  

3. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
    
4. Image path:
    1. There seem to be some problem with the image path, sometimes the relative path works and sometime it doesn't. In that case, the path which consisted of personal directory information was used but It may not work on the lecturers's system since the path has the student's directory. So relative paths were used but sometimes they seem broken for images and it works fine for CSS linking.

In addition, the assignment looks and works fine on different browsers and screen sizes.
The platforms tested are - Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Android, IOS and opera.

I came accross several bugs and careless mistakes from simple missed hyphens to troublesome flex screens. But most of them are fixed. One of the interesting things was when I found out about stacking contents side by side and then re-shuffling the dual grid.
